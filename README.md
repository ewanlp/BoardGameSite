# BoardGameSite
Page dedicated to logging and tracking board game stats, implemented by Luke and Nate Ewan

The csv_files folder contains all current csv files used in phpmyadmin. They will be updated as more plays are logged. The page is written in html, css, js, and python, using a bootstrap framework. The backend is dependent on phpmyadmin. 

Work has been done by both Luke and Nate Ewan, working collaboratively internationally.
